# `odem` -- a command line (& etc.) tool for Sacred Harp Singing Minutes Data

- Includes an interactive text/cli interface, and a conventional CLI
- Telegram Chat Bot. [@fasolaMintesBot](https://t.me/fasolaMinutesBot)
- Non-interactive CLI/Markdown interface.

## Background

As someone with an Android phone--and an utter nerd--I've wanted to
have better access to the Sacred Harp Minutes data, in the past few
years. More up to date. Weird questies. Taking the work Mark has done
with the minutes data for Sacred Harp singing, I wanted to put
together a library/app(lication) for working with the minutes data at
a (potentially) higher level.

As a software engineer, I also mostly end up spending time writing
software that--by its very nature--I don't really use, so it's been
nice to work on something that I'll actually use. It's also fun to be able to make this data accessible in a way that doesn't involve writing queries directly against the database.

This is entirely for fun, and made possible by Mark's
[fasolaminutes_parsing](https://github.com/marktgodfrey/fasolaminutes_parsing/)
(and of course everyone who takes minutes and sings Sacred Harp).

Allowing to the fact that this isn't running on a phone _and_ doesn't
need to be downloaded over a mobile network, it runs some queries that
would either take too long _or_ require storing the data in a way that
wouldn't otherwise be viable. The queries are bordering on the absurd
and to make (most) operations fast, I've done some wacky database that
take up a bunch of (temporary) on the system it runs on. It does many
of the things that the Phone Minutes App does, with some extra things:
Some of the highlights:

- _singing buddies_: who have you been at the most singings with.

- (surprising?) _singing strangers_: who have you _never_ sung with
  (but who have sung with most of the people that you've sung with!)

- singers' "_connectedness_" or the percentage of total singers that
  you've been at singings with.

- _unfamiliar hits_: the most popular songs that are underrepresented
  at the singings you've been at.

- _never sung_: songs that have never been sung at a singing you've
  been at.

- _locally popular_: the most popular songs in your geographic region
  (state, etc.).

- _popular in your experience_: songs that have been sung at singings
  you've been to, ordered by experience.

- _leading role models_: the list if your most frequent leads with the
  most frequent leaders of those songs added in.

- _leader share_: the percentage of all of the leads in the database
  that a specific leader has led (and a list of all leaders ordered by
  number of leads, with the corresponding _cumulative percentage_.)

... and more.

There's a command line interface with a fuzzy-search interface, as
well as the ability to generate markdown files with "reports," for
every query. Coming soon:

- packing/delivering the application in more ways various ways so that
  more people can use it.

- some improvements to the fuzzy search experience to make it feel
  more like an application and less like a weird command line thing.

- more queries and views!

## (possibly) FAQ

- _Why `odem`?_ I wanted to name the program after a sacred harp song,
  but I have projects named after `jasper` (public,) and `sardis`
  (private). I mostly chose it because it has short and it's easy to
  type (letters are split between each hand on a qwerty keyboard.)

- _Why a CLI?_ Most of my computing work happens in CLI and adjacent
  contexts, so this makes sense for me and how I use computers. Also
  broadly speaking, I'm much more "build a CLI" and less of "make an
  app" or "make a website" kind of software engineer.

## The Fine Print

The rest of this file contains a bunch of technical details about the
program, running/developing the software. Feel free to stop here.

Having said that, I don't think you have to be a programmer to use
`odem`, and I've tried to be detailed in the documentation and
instructions below for installing and getting started, so feel free to
stick around. 😃

The application is a fairly modular and largely standard Go
application. The database (sqlite) is pulled from Mark's repository
(as a git submodule) and attached to the binary, and then written out
to your temporary directory (e.g. `/tmp`) when the program runs for
the first time/as needed. When initializing the database, `odem` adds
several indexes, (non-materialized) views, and materialized
projections to optimize and facilitate some the applications more
unique queries. The database bootstrapping takes a bit under 90
seconds (on my not very impressive laptop,) so be ready for that.

Bootstrapping notwithstanding, the application is (relatively
speaking,) very self contained: there's one file, it does its own
setup and it will rebuild the database after upgrades. The fuzzy
search interfaces make it much easier than your average CLI.

I plan to have pre-built artifacts at some point in the future if
pepole are interested in running it themselves, in the mean time, if
you're not used to this kind of thing, this might be a
lot. Apologies...

### Setup

1. You need to install Go. Do that according to [these
   directions](https://go.dev/doc/install). It's probably best if you
   have the latest version of Go, but it needs to be at least Go 1.24.

3. You need to have a working terminal with git. I haven't tested this
   on Macs but it should be fine. There's nothing keeping this from
   working on Windows, particularly WSL, but I know less of the
   details.

   Open the terminal and run the `git` command. If it prints a bunch
   of stuff that starts with `usage` then you're good.

4. Clone the repository and the submodule with the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tychoish/odem.git --recurse-submodules
   ```

   The `--recurse-submodules` option downloads the database from
   Mark's repository and gets it all set up. If you omit this option
   above or clone the repository in another way, and you don't have
   the datebase (run `ls pkg/db/fasoladb` to check), you can setup the
   submodule with:

   ```bash
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update
   ```

3. Build the binary. Use the following command to build the
   application:

   ```bash
   go build ./cmd/odem.go
   ```

   At this point, you can run the program:

   ```bash
   ./odem --help
   ./odem fzf --help
   ./odem report --help
   ./odem navigation --help
   ```

   The first time you actually access the data, the application will
   write out the database. This will also happen any time your
   temporary space is cleared (typically on reboot), you upgrade
   (e.g. run `go build` as above.)

4. **Optional**: Make `odem` accessible from any shell/terminal. I
   prefer to do this by creating a symbolic link in `/usr/local/bin/`
   to the `odem` artifact in this directory. There are other ways, and
   this is optional but:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/odem /usr/local/bin/odem
   ```

   Now from any prompt on your system (assuming `/usr/local/bin` is
   in your (search) `$PATH`), you can run the `odem` command and
   everything should work.

   This only needs to be done once. If it doesn't work your link may
   not be in the search path (or the build may not exist). Run `echo
   $PATH` to see the list (`:` separated) of paths. You can add
   `/usr/local/bin` to your search(for the local session _only_) with:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/"
   ```

   The procedure to make this permanent is probably beyond the scope
   of this document, and depending on your system and configuration.

   At some point soon, hopefully, I'll have an installation procedure
   with fewer sharp edges.

4. You can write the database to the temporary space explicitly:

   ```bash
   odem setup
   ```

   If you want to delete the database, the following operation works:

   ```bash
   odem setup reset
   ```

### Development

#### A Guide to the Codebase

Let's start with a guide to the codebase:

- `cmd/ep/` the entry points for various subcommands. The `odem.go`
  file only registers the top-most level of subcommands: for the most
  part the `cmdr` package makes it possible to have the barest minimum
  of CLI handling code. There are some helper functions (with macro
  vibes) in `pkg/infra/` for the moment.

- `pkg/db` has all of the more complex queries. All functions take
  parameters, and return `iter.Seq2[T, error]` type iterators. Queries
  are function-scoped constants. The `pkg/db/fs.go` file contains the
  database setup, initialization, and management of local database.

- `pkg/models` includes data types generated from the database using
  `sqlc` (and `sqlc` generated queries.) The `usr.go` file contains
  hand-generated models in support of complex queries. Methods on
  these types control some over the rendering of data in other forms.

- `odem` uses `sqlc` for only two purposes:

  1. Some simple "Find One"-type queries, but mostly...

  2. To generate Go models from the database schema, and related
     views. The `pkg/db/views.sql` file, contains a number of
     additional views (which sqlc` will generate a type for.)

  Most of the queries are handled in the `pkg/db` package.

- for the CLI handling the `pkg/dispatch/` contains the registry and
  dispatcher for command line entry points, with the rendering of the
  reports in the `pkg/reportui`. User input is mostly handled by the
  `selector` package.

- other interfaces like MCP (`pkg/mcpsrv`), a telegram bot
  (`pkg/tgbot`) and a menu-driven terminal interface (`pkg/navigator`)
  use much of the same infrastructure to present data in different
  ways.

- `pkg/release` handles some project automation and build tooling, and
  is mostly an experiment to see what it's like to fully bake
  build/release/deployment code into an application and avoid the
  otherwise inevitable collection of makefiles/build scripts/sticky
  tape.

#### AI Coding Assistants

Because it's 2026, there's some scaffolding for using AI coding tools/agents, and I've been using this project as a playground for exploring how to build a reasonable/maintainable piece of software somewhere between "entirely hand coded" and "only vibes."

Agents have written many of the queries, and are responsible for much
of the database optimization, and test code. The architecture and code
organization was manual.

The process of adding a new query is characterized as an agent skill
as `add-minutes-query`. If you direct the agent to use this skill with
a tight/clear description of the analysis, it does a reasonable job of
producing a new operation.

Additionally, I've set up a number of MCP servers that I find useful,
generally: `sqlite` adapters to make it easier to query data from the
database; `gh` cli tool wrappers for github stuff; `gopls` to use the
LSP server to facilitate code editing (with a preference for using
shared instances of `gopls`; as well as `ripgrep` and `godoc` for code
discovery.

In genreal my take, for the moment, is that agents are great for:

- writing tests, both during development and when fixing bugs to
  prevent future regressions.

- characterizing and fixing bugs, particularly the ones that are
  rooted in bad queries, and sometimes ones introduced by manual
  refactors.

- writing deterministic tools, typically somewhat collaboratively with
  an organic programmer.

In persuit of this, I tend to scrutinize anything written by Agents,
and also typically work in a fairly bottom up style, and I tend to
decompose problems to some extent before delegating them to an
agent. While I have long been a skeptic about coding agents, and AI in
general, these tools do a pretty good job of generating SQL queries,
and for developing a robust test suite: at the same time their ability
to "design"/generate a reasonable architecture or interfaces is
somewhat suspect.

The most effective things have been: short prompts that point out
prototypes or patterns that you want to use, including pointers to
where code for various components or connections lives or how it
should be structured, and how you want tests to be written.

#### The `tychoish` Ecosystem

This project uses a collection of other tools and libraries that I've
written that aren't common in Go programs outside of stuff I work on,
in particular:

- [github.com/tychoish/fun](https://github.com/tychoish/fun), which is
  a collection of generic container types, function-object-wrappers,
  error collection, and some ergonomic programming tools. It's
  opinionated and a bit quirky.

  In particular the `irt` library provides tooling for working with
  go's (newish) native iterator types. This leads to a programming
  style that's a bit more "lispy" and lazy/iterator driven, and
  function-centered than the mainline go conventions.

  Also the `strut` package (for **str**ing **ut**ilities) package
  provides some higher-level interaces around `strings.Builder`,
  `bytes.Buffer`, (and `Mutable` for providing a pooled, string-ish
  type around a `[]byte` slice.) This all makes building text and
  string output more ergonomic and higher-level.

- [github.com/tychoish/dbx](https://github.com/tychoish/dbx), is an
  elaboration on the `go-simpler.org/queries` library, with expanded
  support for decoding database-tuples into go types and a more
  optimized query builder.

- I've also used
  [github.com/tychoish/grip](https://github.com/tychoish/grip), a
  structured loggong tool and
  [github.com/tychoish/cmdr](https://github.com/tychoish/cmdr) a CLI
  argument/subcommand framework/builder, but both are older projects
  of mine that have been largely superseded by other tools/approaches.

#### Roadmap

This is all very rough, and mostly to provide a vague idea of the
kinds of things I'm interested in doing.

Additional UIs:

- ~~MCP serer (why not?)~~

- ~~Telegram Bot (for remote access?) and fun.~~

- Minutes data guessing games (for road trips.)

- mostly for giggles, I'd like to see about building an emacs wrapper
  around this using [consult](https://github.com/minad/consult) and
  [marginalia](https://github.com/minad/marginalia) maybe with a
  little tabular mode? 🤷 🖥️

Other features:

- Super-locality queries (e.g. multi-state regions.)

- apply "active singers" (activity in N-years,) filters to more
  queries.

- ratio of leads of a particular song to the leaders set of leads.

Improvements:

- some query parameters are not particularly exposed to users, could
  improve this.

- while the fuzzy search tool is pretty good, it's slightly less
  flexible in some ways than I'd like, and I might explore replacing
  the library that provides this facility.

### Contribution

Definitely down to have other folks play with/add to/this... I'm
particularly interested in this being a jumping off point for singers
who are interested in programming/software/data things but who don't
think of themselves as programmers. Let's talk about it!

Looking forward to singing with you all soon!
